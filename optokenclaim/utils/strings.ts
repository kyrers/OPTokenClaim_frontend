    "   1. EXP holders can call subscribe to register their EXP balance, which will be taken into account for the reward calculation of the current epoch; \n" +
    "   2. Once an epoch has passed, subscribed EXP holders will be able to claim their previous epoch reward by clicking on \"claim\"; \n" +
    "   3. Once claimed, the contract automatically resubscribes you for the next reward distribution; \n\n" +
    "If you subscribe and then earn more EXP, you can just resubscribe with your updated EXP balance. \n\n" +
    "TLDR: Subscribe if you hold EXP, wait until the current epoch ends, claim your OP. Repeat every 30 days. \n\n" +
